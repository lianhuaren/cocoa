Lesson 23
在决定什么能吃而什么不能吃的时候，人们往往变得不合情理。比如，如果你住在地中海地区，你会把章鱼视作
是美味佳肴，同时不能理解为什么有人一见章鱼就恶心。另一方面，你一想到动物油炸土豆就会反胃，但这在北方许多
国家却是一种普通的烹饪方法。不无遗憾的是，我们中的大部分人，生来就只吃某几种食品，而且一辈子都这样。

People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and what cannot be 
eaten. If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great 
delicacy. You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive. On the 
other hand, your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat -- the normally 
accepted practice in many northern countries.  The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up 
to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.
