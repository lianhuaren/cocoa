Lesson 15

有两个因素严重地妨碍工业中科学研究的效率 一是科研工作中普遍存在的保密气氛 二是研究人员缺乏个人自由。
任何一项研究都涉及到保密，那些从事科研的人员自然受到了限制。他们不能和其他国家、其他大学、甚至往往不能
与本公司的其他部门的同行们进行有效的接触。保密程度自然差别很大。有些大公司进行的研究属于一般和基础的研究，
因此不保密对他们才有李。然而，以来这种研究的很多工艺程序是在完全保密的情况下进行的，直到可以取得专利权
的阶段为止。更多的工艺过程根本不会取得专利权，而是作为秘方保存着。在这化学工业方面尤为突出。同物理
和机械工业相比，化学工业中偶然发现的机会要多得多。有时，保密尽然达到了这样的程度，即连研究工作的整个性质
都不准提及。比如，很多公司向图书馆借阅科技书籍时感到困难，因为他们不愿让人家记下它们公司的名字和借阅
的某一本书。他们生怕别的公司的情报人员据此摸到他们可能要从事的某项科研项目。

Two factos weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry. One is the 
general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out, the other the lack of freedom of the 
individual research worker. In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those 
engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries 
or in universities, or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm. The degress of 
secrecy naturally varies considerably. Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches 
which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to 
keep them secret. Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with 
complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out. Even more processes are never 
patented at all but kept as secret processes. This applies particularly to chemical industries, where 
chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries. 
Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research cannot be 
mentioned. Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books
from libraries because they are unwilling to have names entered as having taken out such and 
such a book, for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are 
likely to be undertaking.
