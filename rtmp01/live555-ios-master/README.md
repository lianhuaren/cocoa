Live555 for iOS
===============

This project is an attempt to build Live555 as a (fat) static library suitable
for incorporation in an iOS application. The eventual goal is to provide a
sample Xcode project which demonstrates basic usage and can be used in the
simulator (i386) as well as the mobile devices (arm6 and arm7).

The project is a work in progress and is not yet stable.
